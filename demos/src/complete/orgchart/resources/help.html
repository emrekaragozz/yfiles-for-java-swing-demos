    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      An organizational chart gives a clear picture of a company's staff and structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This demo is a great example of how to use many yFiles features with little code to create a powerful application.
      Observe the benefits of level-of-detail rendering with visually rich node representations: from mere outlines of
      your data when looking at the entire diagram to all details when zooming in, this technique is easily realized
      with our library.

    <h2>Organization Chart</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Mouse Wheel</dt>
      <dd>Changes the zoom level of the view.</dd>
      <dt>Click on Employee</dt>
      <dd>Focuses the employee in the chart and shows the corresponding data in the
        Properties View.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Properties View</h2>

    <p>Click on a superior, subordinate, or colleague link to focus and zoom to the corresponding node in the organization chart.</p>
