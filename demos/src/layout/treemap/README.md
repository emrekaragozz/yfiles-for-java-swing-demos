# Tree Map
  

 Tree maps allow to visualize hierarchical data using nested rectangles, which in this case are represented by graph nodes. The size of the leaf nodes in a tree map is proportional to a certain data value (i.e. weight). The [TreeMapLayout](https://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.layout.tree.TreeMapLayout) algorithm arranges nodes according to their weights and relations inside groups.
