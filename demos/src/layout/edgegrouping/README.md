# Edge Grouping
  

 Shows the effects of edge and port grouping when arranging graphs with [HierarchicLayout](https://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.layout.hierarchic.HierarchicLayout) .   

 Edge groups lead to edges sharing some of their path segments while port groups will combine the edges only in their first path segment.
