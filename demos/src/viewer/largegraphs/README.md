# Large Graphs
  

 This demo illustrates improvements in rendering performance for very large graphs in yFiles for Java (Swing). The default settings are adequate for graphs up to a few hundred elements. Scaling to several thousands of elements is possible with a bit of tweaking, though.   

 The impact of each individual setting depends on the graph, its layout, and how you interact with it. This demo comes with settings tailored to each example graph. Your use cases might require different parameters or even other methods.
