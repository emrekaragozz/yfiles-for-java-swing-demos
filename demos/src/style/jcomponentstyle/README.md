# JComponent Styles
  

 An outstanding feature of yFiles for Java (Swing) is the ability to use any Swing components directly as graph elements. Combine the layout and visualization capabilities of yFiles with your custom Swing components or Swing application!   

 The yFiles for Java (Swing) JComponent styles allow to use arbitrary Swing `JComponent` s for the visualization of graph items, while being able to access all relevant context information as client properties.
