  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>
    This demo displays graphs in an isometric fashion to create an impression
    of a 3-dimensional view.
  </p>

  <h2>Interaction</h2>
  <p>
    As this demo is mainly a viewer, it is not possible to edit the graph structure.  
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Left Click on Group State Icon opens/closes the group node and
      shows/hides its children.
    </li>
    <li>
      Left Drag on View moves view according to the difference between drag
      start and current mouse position.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mouse Wheel changes the zoom level of the view.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Layout</h2>
  <p>
    There are two layout algorithms well-suited for arranging graphs in
    isometric views: Hierarchic layout and orthogonal layout.
  </p><p>
    By default, hierarchic layout is used.
  </p><p>
    However, the source code of the demo is organized in such a way that
    switching to orthogonal layout is a simple matter of changing the value of
    field <code>layoutStyle</code> in the main demo class.
  </p><p>
    Opening/closing group nodes automatically re-arranges the the current
    diagram with the chosen layout algorithm.
