  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>
    This demo illustrates how to handle mouse clicks in specific areas of a
    node's visualization.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, clicks inside the style's decoration image are handled
    even in the area that extends over the associated node's rectangular bounds.
  </p>
  <p>
    See the sources of class <code>NodeStyleDecorator</code> and its nested
    class <code>ClickHandler</code> for details.
