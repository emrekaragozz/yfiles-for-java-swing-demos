<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
  Configure the <a href="http://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.view.input.GraphEditorInputMode">GraphEditorInputMode</a> so that only one graph item can be selected at a time.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
      Toggle single selection mode using the respective button.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try to drag the mouse over a set of nodes to select them. Marquee selection is completely disabled in single selection mode.

      Click select a node. Try to extend the selection by holding the Ctrl/Command key down and click another node.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click select a node. Try to extend the selection by holding the Shift key down and press one of the arrow keys
      to extend the selection to a certain direction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try to select all nodes by pressing Ctrl/Command-A.
    </li>
    <li>
      Select a single node. You can toggle the selection state by hitting Ctrl/Command-Space. This works for single
      selection as well as in <em>normal</em> mode due to a custom command binding.
    </li>

      Click select a single node. Move the item focus (indicated by a thin dashed line) by holding the Ctrl/Command key down
      and pressing one of the arrow keys. Toggle the selection state of the focused item by pressing Ctrl/Command-Space.
