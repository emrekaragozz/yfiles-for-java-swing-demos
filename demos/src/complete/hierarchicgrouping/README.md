# Hierarchic Grouping
  

 To keep track of the structure and connections of large and complex graphs and to visualize them clearly and straightforward, yFiles for Java (Swing) offers the ability to divide those graphs into multiple groups or folders and to dynamically show or hide those separate parts.   

 The incremental layout approach ensures that the arrangement of the already visible parts of the graph is kept as consistent as possible after expanding or collapsing a group.
