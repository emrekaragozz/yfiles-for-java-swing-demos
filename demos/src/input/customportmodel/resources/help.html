<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
  This demo shows how to create and use a custom <i>IPortLocationModel</i>.
</p>


<h2>Things to try</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Create new nodes in the canvas and interconnect them with new edges.</p>
    <p>Note that a specialized set of possible port candidates is shown.
      The candidates use a custom port location model that offers five possible locations
      on each node.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on one of the nodes and then drag the handle that depicts a port.</p>
    <p>Note that you can only drag the handle to the locations that are supported by the model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try saving and loading the graph. Note that for this custom port location model serialization is easy
      because of the MarkupExtension based serialization mechanism that is used to
      serialize the (otherwise) internal parameter class which can only be created via the factory methods.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
