<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  This demo shows the usage of ports by taking the example of a digital system consisted of logic gates.
</p>

<p>
  Each node in this system has specific ports for incoming and outgoing edges.
</p>
<p>
  Incoming edges are connected only to green ports (usually on the left side of the target node).
  Outgoing edges connect to blue ports (usually on the right side of the source node).
</p>
<p>
  To achieve this, the notions of <em>PortConstraint</em> and <em>PortCandidate</em> have been used.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Drag nodes from the palette. Notice that the new nodes already have green and blue ports.</li>
  <li>Hover over a node to see which ports are valid (highlighted with green color) and
    invalid (highlighted with red color) to start an edge creation.</li>
  <li>Create a new edge by dragging from a valid port. While creating the connection, the valid and invalid end ports are
    indicated with green and red color again.
    The edge will be created in the direction that has been selected from the <em>Edge Direction Policy</em>:
  <ul>
    <li><em>Start at source</em>: Edges can only be created from source (blue) to target (green) ports.</li>
    <li><em>Start at target</em>: Edges can only be created from target (green) to source (blue) port.</li>
    <li><em>Keep direction</em>: Edges will be created in the same direction as last time.</li>
    <li><em>Determine from port candidates</em>: Edges will be created in the direction depending on whether the
      creation started at a source or target port.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Re-assign a connection by selecting the edge and dragging one of its endpoints.</li>
  <li>Apply a new <em>HierarchicLayout</em> or <em>Route Edges</em> and notice that the ports remain unchanged.</li>
</ul>
