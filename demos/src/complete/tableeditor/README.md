# Table Editor
  

 Tables are an important visualization concept to organize and structure data and are used e.g. in business process diagrams. yFiles for Java (Swing) supports creating and editing table nodes out-of-the-box as shown in this demo.   

 You may create and modify the table structure via drag-and-drop, re-arrange rows and columns by dragging their headers and resize them by dragging their borders. Additionally, automatic layout calculates a clear routing and placement of the table contents at the press of a button.
