<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  The GraphML compatibility demo shows how to enable GraphML backwards
  compatibility for reading files written in version 3.0.x.
</p>
<p>
  GraphML is the standard file format for yFiles for Java (Swing). It is an XML format
  that provides great flexibility when storing custom data. The format has
  changed between version 3.1.x and earlier versions and requires conversion.
