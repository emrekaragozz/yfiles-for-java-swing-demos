<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  Tables are an important visualization concept to organize and structure
  data and are used e.g. in business process diagrams.
  yFiles for Java (Swing) supports creating and editing table nodes out-of-the-box
  as shown in this demo.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Select a row or column by clicking on its header. Multiple rows or columns can be selected by keeping Ctrl/Command pressed.
    Note that selecting a graph element will clear the table selection and vice versa.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press F2 to edit the label of a selected stripe. Enter an empty text to remove the label.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press the right mouse button on a stripe header to activate a popup menu.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Modifying the table</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    A new row or column can be added by dragging the corresponding item from the list and dropping it onto a table group
    node.
  </li>
  <li>
    Selected items can be deleted using the DELETE key or the corresponding menu entry. Children will be re-parented to
    the deleted stripe's parent. The parent and/or the siblings are resized to disturb the overall table layout as
    little as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    A stripe can be moved by dragging it on its header to a different position in the table. The highlights indicate
    whether the stripe is added as a new child or as a sibling of the drop target. Moving a stripe will move all its
    children as well as its contents.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Resizing stripes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Drag a stripe border to resize the stripe. By default, the neighbor stripes and their contents are moved.
  </li>
  <li>
    Except for the topmost/leftmost borders, resizing always extends the stripe to the bottom/to the right.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press Shift at the beginning of the gesture to redistribute the sizes of the two attached stripes.
  </li>
  <li>
    By default, stripe borders cannot be dragged over content nodes. Press Ctrl/Command at the beginning of the resize gesture
    to resize the stripes freely.
  </li>
  <li>
    Resizing the table node will resize the outermost stripe(s) accordingly.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Automatic layout</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A node is associated to the row and column its center coordinates lie in. Therefore it can be associated to another
    row or column by simply dragging in to a new position.
  </li>
  <li>
    A new layout for the tables and their contents can be calculated by pressing the layout button in the tool bar.
  </li>
</ul>
