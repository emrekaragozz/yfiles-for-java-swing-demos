<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Explore the event system of yFiles.
</p>

<p>
  The events are logged to the Event Log panel. Event logging can be switched on and off
  for different kinds of events using the Event Log Options. When looking for an event you
  want to subscribe to, you should generally start looking at the top of the list above and work
  your way down. I.e. in most cases it is recommended to use events of a particular input mode
  instead of subscribing to the low-level graph events (which should be reserved for rare,
  exceptional cases where the layers above won't suffice).
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Toggle the various event log options to see different kinds of events.</li>
  <li>Create, delete, move, resize and edit graph items.</li>
  <li>Move the whole graph within the viewport by dragging the mouse (Ctrl-Drag in Edit Mode).</li>
  <li>Select and deselect graph items.</li>
  <li>Expand, collapse, enter and exit group nodes.</li>
  <li>Toggle the input mode using the "Toggle Editing" button.</li>
</ul>
