 This folder and its subfolders contain demo applications which make use of the different layout algorithms of the layout component of yFiles for Java (Swing).   

| Demo | Description |
|------|:-----------:|
|[LayoutStyles](../../src/layout/layoutstyles/README.md)| Play with the most used layout algorithms of yFiles. |
|[HierarchicLayout](../../src/layout/hierarchiclayout/README.md)| Showcase of one of our central layout algorithms, the HierarchicLayout. |
|[InteractiveOrganicLayout](../../src/layout/interactiveorganic/README.md)| Use InteractiveOrganicLayout for organic layout in interactive environments. |
|[EdgeBundling](../../src/layout/edgebundling/README.md)| Shows how edge bundling can be applied for reducing visual cluttering in dense graphs. |
|[PartitionGrid](../../src/layout/partitiongrid/README.md)| Demonstrates the usage of a *PartitionGrid* for hierarchic and organic layout calculations. |
|[Sankey](../../src/layout/sankey/README.md)| Showcase of how a Sankey diagram can be produced by means of the HierarchicLayout. |
