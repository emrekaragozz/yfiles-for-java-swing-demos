<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  yFiles for Java (Swing) is shipped with its own armada of graph analysis algorithms to attack problems to efficiently
  visualize your data. One of these is the shortest path search which is visualized in this small demo.
</p>

<h2> Things to try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Mark source and target nodes by selecting a node, then clicking on the <em>Mark as Source</em> or <em>Mark as Target</em>
    button.
    Select multiple nodes by a marquee selection with the mouse, or use the Ctrl/Command key when clicking on a
    node to add it to an existing selection.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The shortest path is calculated and marked in red as soon as at least one source and one target are
        selected.
      </li>
      <li>
        The shortest path is the one with the smallest cost, where cost is the sum of the visible lengths of the
        edges.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Use <em>Uniform Edge Labels</em> to give each edge equal weight specified in the text field. The shortest path becomes
    the one where the sum of the edge weights is the smallest, i.e. the one with the fewest edges.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press F2 to open the label editor for a selected edge and change the weight to see how the shortest
    paths are affected.
  </li>
  <li>
    Toggle between <em>Directed</em> and <em>Undirected</em> edges to either taking edge direction into account or ignoring it
    when performing a shortest path search.
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit the graph by creating, deleting, or moving nodes, edges, and bends. Observe how paths are affected. Edits
    immediately trigger a new shortest path search.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select different automatic layout styles from the drop-down in the toolbar and observe how the changed edge
    lengths affect the shortest path search.
  </li>
</ul>
