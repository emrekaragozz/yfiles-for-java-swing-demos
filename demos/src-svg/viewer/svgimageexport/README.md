# SVG Image Export
  

 With the use of the BATIK library yFiles for Java (Swing) provides capabilities to export a graph in the SVG format. Furthermore, it is able to draw arbitrary objects onto the `GraphComponent` and interact with them via `InputModes` . 

 The demo's ANT build file automatically downloads a suitable version of the BATIK library.
