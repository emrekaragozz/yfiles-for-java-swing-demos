# Layout Styles
  

 Switch between several sample graphs and play with the most used layout algorithms of yFiles, including hierarchic, organic, orthogonal, tree, circular and balloon styles.   

 The configuration panel provides access to the most important settings of each algorithm. Typically, an algorithm allows even more options in code.
