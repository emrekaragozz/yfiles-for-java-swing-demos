<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
  Showing and hiding parts of a graph can be useful for selectively focusing attention on different areas.
</p>

<p>
  With collapsible trees, you enable users to collapse and expand subtrees simply by clicking on their root node.
  Switch between tree, balloon, hierarchic, organic and orthogonal layouts.
</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>

<h3>Expand/Collapse subtrees</h3>
Click a note with a +/- button. Note that there are also leaf nodes
that cannot be expanded any further

<h3>Select layout style</h3>
Choose a new automatic layout style from the drop-down in the toolbar.
Choosing a new style, or expanding and collapsing nodes, triggers a refresh of the layout.

<h3>Change zoom level</h3>
Use toolbar buttons to focus on local areas or to view the complete graph.
