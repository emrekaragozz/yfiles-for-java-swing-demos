# Layout Demos
  

 This folder and its subfolders contain demo applications which make use of the different layout algorithms of the layout component of yFiles for Java (Swing).   

| Demo | Description |
|------|-------------|
|[LayoutStyles](../../src/layout/layoutstyles/)| Play with the most used layout algorithms of yFiles. |
|[HierarchicLayout](../../src/layout/hierarchiclayout/)| Showcase of one of our central layout algorithms, the HierarchicLayout. |
|[InteractiveOrganicLayout](../../src/layout/interactiveorganic/)| Use InteractiveOrganicLayout for organic layout in interactive environments. |
|[FamilyTree](../../src/layout/familytree/)| This demo shows how genealogical graphs (family trees) can be visualized. |
|[CriticalPaths](../../src/layout/criticalpaths/)| This demo shows how to emphazise important paths with hierarchic and tree layout algorithms. |
|[EdgeBundling](../../src/layout/edgebundling/)| Shows how edge bundling can be applied for reducing visual cluttering in dense graphs. |
|[EdgeGrouping](../../src/layout/edgegrouping/)| Shows the effects of edge and port grouping when arranging graphs with HierarchicLayout. |
|[PartialLayout](../../src/layout/partiallayout/)| Shows how to arrange some elements in a graph while keeping other elements fixed. |
|[PartitionGrid](../../src/layout/partitiongrid/)| Demonstrates the usage of a *PartitionGrid* for hierarchic and organic layout calculations. |
|[Sankey](../../src/layout/sankey/)| Showcase of how a Sankey diagram can be produced by means of the HierarchicLayout. |
|[SplitEdges](../../src/layout/splitedges/)| Shows how to align edges at group nodes using RecursiveGroupLayout together with HierarchicLayout. |
|[TreeLayout](../../src/layout/treelayout/)| Demonstrates the tree layout style and the different ways in which this layout can arrange a node and its children. |
|[TreeMap](../../src/layout/treemap/)| Shows disk usage of a directory tree with the Tree Map layout. |
