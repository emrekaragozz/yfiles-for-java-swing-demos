<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  Demonstrates how to implement a custom <code>INodeStyle</code> that
  displays Scalable Vector Graphics. The BATIK library is used for handling
  the required (low-level) SVG rendering.
  <br>
  Additionally, this demo shows how to configure yFiles for Java (Swing)'s
  <code>GraphMLIOHandler</code> to embed displayed SVG documents in
  GraphML.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Zoom in and out and/or resize nodes.
    Unlike raster images, the quality of the displayed vector graphics will
    not diminish when changing zoom levels or node sizes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move nodes around with double-buffering enabled and double-buffering
    disabled to get an impression of the performance improvement gained through
    double-buffering.
  </li>
  <li>
    Save a displayed graph and inspect the generated GraphML file.
  </li>
</ul>
