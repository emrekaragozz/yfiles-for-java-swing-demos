<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  Keep complex hierarchically organized diagrams clear and straightforward by showing only
  parts of the entire structure.
</p>

<p>
  The incremental layout approach ensures that the arrangement of the already visible parts of the graph is kept as
  consistent as possible after expanding or collapsing a group.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Click on the +/- button of a group node to expand or collapse it.</li>
</ul>
