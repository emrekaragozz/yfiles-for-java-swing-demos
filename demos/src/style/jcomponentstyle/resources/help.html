<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  An outstanding feature of yFiles for Java (Swing) is the ability to use any Swing components directly as graph elements.
  Combine the layout and visualization capabilities of yFiles with your custom Swing components or Swing application!
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Select nodes or edge labels to see custom selection highlighting (borders) defined in the node and label components.
  </li>
  <li>
    Change the focused node using Ctrl/Command + &lt;arrow key&gt; to see custom focus highlighting (background color of the top label)
    defined in the node components.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create new customers by Shift clicking and new products by Ctrl/Command clicking on the background.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create new relations between customers and products with the component label visualization. Note that edges can
    only be created from customer to product nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit the name or id of a customer or product by clicking on the name or id and editing the text field. Note how
    the labels of connected edges are updates when the text fields lose focus after editing.
  </li>
  <li>
    All edits of node properties are written back to the custom user-tag data of the nodes. Save a modified graph
    and have a look at the GraphML file to see the changed user-tag data.
  </li>
</ul>
