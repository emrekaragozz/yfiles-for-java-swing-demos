# SVG Node Style
  

 Demonstrates how to implement a custom `INodeStyle` that displays Scalable Vector Graphics. The BATIK library is used for handling the required (low-level) SVG rendering. Additionally, this demo shows how to configure yFiles for Java (Swing)'s `GraphMLIOHandler` to embed displayed SVG documents in GraphML. 

 The demo's ANT build file automatically downloads a suitable version of the BATIK library.
