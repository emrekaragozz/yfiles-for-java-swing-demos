# Hierarchic Layout
  

 Graphs in applications often dynamically change over time. yFiles for Java (Swing) layout algorithms can be used to adapt changes incrementally by adding nodes and edges to an existing layout and dynamically assigning port constraints.   

 Try to create new nodes and observe how they are inserted into the drawing near the place they have been created. You can also add new edges and watch the routings being calculated immediately. The first and last bend of an edge can be dragged to interactively assign or reset port constraints.
