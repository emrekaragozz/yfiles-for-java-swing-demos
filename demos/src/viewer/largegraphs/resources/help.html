<h1>Description</h1>
<p>This demo illustrates improvements in rendering performance for very large graphs
  in yFiles for Java (Swing). The default settings are adequate for graphs up to a few hundred elements.
  Scaling to several thousands of elements is possible with a bit of tweaking, though.</p>
<p>The impact of each individual setting depends on the graph, its layout, and how you
  interact with it. This demo comes with settings tailored to each example graph. Your use
  cases might require different parameters or even other methods.</p>

<h2>Things To Try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Modify the different parameters on the left to see their effect on performance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the animations in the lower left to quickly test setting changes on
      common interaction patterns like zooming or panning the viewport (the spiral zoom
      tests both at the same time), or moving nodes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watch the information counters in the lower left to see the impact of the
      parameters on frame rate. Frame rate must be observed while running an animation, though.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select nodes, edges and labels either by clicking them, using marquee
      selection or by using the selection tools in the lower left. Observe the impact
      on performance, especially with large selections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read on below and in the source code for an explanation of each parameter
      and technique.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Drawing the overview is costly since the number of visuals in the overview component
  is the same as in the normal graph control. Therefore, before investigating other aspects
  it is recommended to disable the overview.</p>

<h2>Faster Item Styles</h2>

<p>A large portion of rendering time is spent in creating and updating the visuals for
  graph items via their styles. In this case, features with large performance impact are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Label text is rendered at zoom levels where definitely no text is readable anymore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Label placement is costly, especially with edge labels, where most label
      models will take the edge's path into account.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edge paths are clipped at their end node shapes, which isn't visible at low
      zoom levels.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Label Text Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Label text is approximated by lines instead of drawing the actual text.
      This helps to still see where labels are but text at those sizes wouldn't be readable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Labels are hidden completely below a certain zoom level.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Edge Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Omit clipping the edge at the node's shape and simply draw line segments
      to the port locations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For lower zoom levels ignore bends and just draw a straight line between
      the two ports. Note that in this case labels would be placed wrongly, so it's
      advisable to only display edge labels above this threshold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For lower zoom levels, if the edge would be drawn at a very short length
      on screen, omit them instead. This especially concerns edges between nodes that
      are very close together, in which case the nodes provide enough visual aid to see
      the graph structure.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Selection Performance</h2>

<p>Selections, especially drawing the selection decoration and the resize handles, can
  be slow, especially when several thousand elements are selected. Basically this adds at
  least as many elements to the visual tree as there are selected items, so a performance
  drop can be expected. By disabling handles and using dedicated decoration renderers we can
  keep the impact a bit lower.</p>

<h2>Label Model Baking</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, calculating label placement can be expensive. While hiding
  labels at low zoom levels is a good way to cope with this, there are more drastic measures
  that can be taken if the graph is known to not change. By replacing all label's models
  with a suitable
  <em>FreeLabelModel</em> parameter, the
  amount of work to determine label placement can be minimized. The drawback is that labels
  now no longer move with their nodes or edges.
</p>

<h2>Visual Caching</h2>
<p>
  Creating a visual can be expensive when for example text size calculation or geometric calculations are involved.
</p>
<p>
  When an item is moved outside the viewport, it usually gets disposed and has to be recreated when it comes inside
  again.
  With a weak or strong <em>VisualCachingPolicy</em>, visuals that have a registered <em>IDisposeVisualCallback</em>
  may get cached and reused later when they got visible again.
</p>
<p>
  This can reduce expensive visual creation but has the drawback of an increased memory consumption.
