# Collapsible Trees
  

 Showing and hiding parts of a graph can be useful for selectively focusing attention on different areas.   

 With collapsible trees, you enable users to collapse and expand subtrees simply by clicking on their root node. Switch between tree, balloon, hierarchic, organic and orthogonal layouts, with the state of subtrees persisting as the layouts adjust.
