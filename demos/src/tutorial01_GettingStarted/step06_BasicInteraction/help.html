<h2>Step 6: Basic Interaction</h2>
<p>
  The <a href="http://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.view.input.GraphEditorInputMode">GraphEditorInputMode</a> is an
  input mode that supports a large number of ways to interact with the graph and its view, for example moving, deleting,
  creating, and resizing of graph elements.
</p>
<p>
  To <em>select</em> a single element just click it with the mouse. Press Alt to step through the different
  possible hits (e.g. to select a node label inside its owner). To select multiple elements, either extend an existing
  selection by pressing Ctrl while clicking, or drag a selection rectangle over all graph elements that you
  want in your selection. Ctrl/Command-A selects all elements.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Resize nodes</em> with the handles of selected nodes.
</p>
<p>
  To <em>move</em> a node or bend, just drag it when it is selected.
</p>
<p>
  To <em>create an edge</em>, start dragging anywhere on the unselected source node and stop dragging on the target
  node.
</p>
<p>
  To <em>create an edge bend</em>, click and drag the edge at the desired bend location. To create a bend during edge
  creation, release the left mouse button anywhere on an empty spot the canvas while dragging. Then click to create more
  bends.
</p>
<p>
  Nodes may provide <em>multiple ports</em>. You can create an edge directly between specific ports and move the source
  or target to a different port at any time. Note that this is not part of this step but shown later.
</p>
<p>
  To create or <em>edit a label</em>, just press F2 when the owner is selected.
</p>
<p>
  To <em>move a label</em>, just drag it to the desired location. If the label model supports only discrete positions,
  these positions are indicated by empty rectangles when you start dragging the label. In this case, you can only move a
  label to one of these positions.
