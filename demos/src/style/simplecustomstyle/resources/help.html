<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  A major feature in yFiles for Java (Swing) is that you can easily customize the existing visualization of
  graph elements. Even your very own styles can be implemented in just a few easy steps.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Create new nodes in the canvas and inspect their styles in code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create edges between nodes and inspect the custom style of the edge and the arrows in code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click <em>Modify Selected Nodes</em> to change the color of the selected nodes instance and indirectly the color of the outgoing
    edges.
  </li>
  <li>
    Note that the labels look like nodes connected via an edge, however they are ordinary labels that reuse the edge
    style for drawing a node to label connection. Select and drag a label to move them to different locations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Also note that the label style depends on the current zoom. Zooming closer to the label reveals an edit label
    button that, when clicked starts label text editing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Selecting an edge changes its color and the traditional selection indicator is not rendered.
  </li>
</ul>
