<h1>Quick Reference</h1>
<p>
  Experience intuitive diagram creation, editing capabilities, and automatic diagram layout provided by yFiles for Java (Swing).
</p>
<p>
  It is very easy to add, delete, move and label nodes and
  edges to create a nice diagram. You can interact with the diagram using zoom and pan, undo/redo, copy/paste, and
  much more.
</p>

<h3>Creating nodes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Click at an empty location on the canvas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating edges</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Drag the mouse with the left button held down on a node.</li>
    <li>Complete the creation by releasing the mouse button on a target node.</li>
    <li>Abort the creation by pressing the Esc key.</li>
    <li>Create control points (bends) during edge creation by clicking on an empty area
    of the canvas, remove the last control point and finally cancel edge creation with Right-Click.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating and editing labels</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Press the F2 key while an element or connection is selected.</li>
    <li>Alternatively double-click an element, connection or label.</li>
</ul>

    The clipboard's contents can be pasted into the diagram with Ctrl/Command + V.</li>
    <li>Cut, copy, and paste are also available in the tool bar and the <em>Edit</em> menu.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Undo/Redo</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The last edit operations can be undone by pressing Ctrl/Command + Z, clicking the undo button in the

    Ctrl/Command + Y, the redo button or selecting <em>Edit</em>/<em>Redo</em> from the menu.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Removing or duplicating elements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All currently selected items are removed by pressing the delete key. Removing is also available in the tool bar
    and the <em>Edit</em> menu.</li>
  <li>All currently selected items are duplicated by pressing Ctrl/Command + D. Duplicating is also available in the <em>Edit</em> menu.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changing edge direction</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To change the direction of the currently selected edges press Ctrl/Command + R or the appropriate menu item in the <em>Edit</em>
    menu.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grouping</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Selected nodes can be grouped into a group node by pressing Ctrl/Command + G. The group node's site will
    be adjusted to its contents.
    A node can be added to a group node or removed from a group node by dragging it with the Shift
    key held down. The group which will be the node's parent is indicated by highlighted corners.</li>
    <li>Deleting a group node will remove the group node but not its children.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collapsing and expanding groups</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Collapse a selected and expanded group node by pressing Ctrl/Command + Minus. Collapse
    is also available in the <em>Grouping</em> menu. Collapse an unselected and expanded

    <li>Expand a selected and collapsed group node by pressing Ctrl/Command + Plus. Expand is

    node by clicking the Plus button in the top left corner of the node.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Entering and exiting groups</h3>

    <li>Exit a group node by pressing Ctrl/Command + BACKSPACE. Exit is also available in the <em>Grouping</em> menu.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Orthogonal edge creation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Switch orthogonal edges on/off in the toolbar.</li>
    <li>Change the outgoing node side by pressing the space bar while creating an orthogonal edge (before creating a bend).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Snapping</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Switch snapping on/off in the toolbar.</li>
